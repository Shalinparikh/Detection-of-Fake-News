# Detection of Fake News
In this project, I have created a deep learning model that automatically predicts whether or not a website or article is fake. The project uses Deep Natural Language Processing to answer the major problems of false news and misinformation in today's world. It achieves an accuracy of approximately 97% in classifying websites as fake or not.
